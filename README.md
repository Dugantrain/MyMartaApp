# MyMartaApp

Basically, I'm diving into Xamarin.  I figured since I usually take Marta into work, I'd whip up a little util on top of the Marta Rail api that can tell me how far out the next train is.  There are a 1/2 dozen or so utilites in the Play Store that do exactly this.  One day, this will be one of them.
